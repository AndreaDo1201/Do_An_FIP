            Spring offers the year's best Moose viewing and you typically don't
            have to search very hard to see Moose. The application of salt to
            Highway 60 during winter road maintenance operations, attracts Moose
            to roadside ditches.<br />
            We provide clothing to keep you warm and dry, includes 100%
            windproof& waterproof pants and jackets plus polar fleece interiors,
            if needed. We recommend that you bring good hiking shoes.<br />
            We provide free passes into Algonquin Park with your stay with
            us.<br />
            Algonquin Park's two museums, the Visitor Centre and Logging Museum,
            are open daily (see the Events Calendar for specific operating dates
            and hours) offering all visitors park information, plus outstanding
            natural and cultural history exhibits.<br />
            From late April into May, a select group of wildflowers called
            “spring ephemerals” grow and bloom in the brief window between the
            spring snow melt and leaf-out of the overhead canopy of trees. Once
            the canopy has filled in, very little light reaches the forest floor
            and many of these wildflowers go into dormancy until the next year,
            staying alive as a rootstock underground.

          <p class="faq-answer">
            Summer in Algonquin Park comes later than surrounding areas as a
            result of the Park's higher elevations.<br />
            We provide free passes into Algonquin Park with your stay with
            us.<br />
            Algonquin Park's two museums, the Visitor Centre and Logging Museum,

            Algonquin Park's interpretive walking trails are available for day
            hiking outings. Trails are open year-round, but trail guide booklets
            are available at trail heads from late spring to early fall.

          <p class="faq-answer">
            During late fall, you'll have a good chance of seeing a big bull
            Moose, its antlers now full-grown and polished, ready for the rut
            (mating season - give them lots of room). Fall evenings are the best
            time to try howling for wolves, you may want to try it yourself.

        <p>
          Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in Ontario, protected from
          the noise and rush of civilization, this world-renowned park in
          Ontario is a sanctuary for the rugged beauty of the maple, pine,
          moose, and wolves. A Provincial Park since 1893, the 7500 square
          kilometers (3500 square miles) of Algonquin Park are home to a diverse
          and unblemished eco-system that can be found nowhere else on earth.<br />
          Glaciers that receded ten thousand years ago created the distinctive
          rock outcroppings and spring-fed lakes of Algonquin. These mountains
          of ice have left the park with a rough, stark beauty. This, combined
          with its location, 3 hours northeast of Toronto and 2 1/2 hours west
          of Ottawa makes Algonquin an ideal attraction for those looking to
          escape the hustle of the city.<br />
          This majestic park, minutes away and seen from our lakeshore, is
          awe-inspiring and completely peaceful with the incredible beauty of
          nature. Come experience the Algonquin grandeur, with all its fresh
          clean air, deep blue skies, rich green forests and hundreds of
          pristine lakes. It is impressive. <br />
          Algonquin park just steps away from The Couples Resort, Algonquin's
          7,630 square kilometres of forests, lakes, and rivers have assumed an
          almost incalculable importance as a living link with a vanishing past.
          Ontario's Algonquin Park and Area has more than 30 species of mammals,
          many are nocturnal or mostly subterranean and therefore not
          encountered. Listed are most commonly seen mammals, birds and
          reptilesin the Algonquin Park& Area.

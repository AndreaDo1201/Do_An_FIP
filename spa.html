            Touching is healing; from a mother's touch which comforts and
            soothes her baby to the triumphant athlete patted on the back by
            fellow athletes. Based on the same principle as human touch, massage
            is the oldest method  of promoting good health, suppleness and
            strength. Today, the role of massage therapy is recognized by the
            general public and other health care professionals as being an
            effective health care alternative. Due to public perception and
            desire, massage therapy has grown into a more prominent position. It
            is a viable and respected profession promoting good health not only
            for your physical but emotional well being also. Massage Therapy is
            the kneading, manipulation or application of methodical pressure and
            friction of the body. Whether it is for treatment of injury, stress
            or for relaxation, the skilled use of massage through touch is used
            to maintain and enhance the health and well being of the entire
            body. Experience the benefits massage can offer you.

          It is very rare that one of our Spa Professionals gets sick or has a
          family emergency and we understand it is extremely disappointing to
          not have the treatment you requested. Staff will make every effort in
          finding an alternative time in the day or during your stay with
          another therapist, sometimes involving a slightly different Treatment.
          We appreciate our guests for being so patient during these unforeseen
          circumstances. Currently if there is a cancellation and you cannot be
          accommodated, there will be no Spa charge to your room. A Free Voucher
          for a 1 hour (Not RMT) Spa Treatment will now be provided for your
          next getaway at the Couples Resort.<br />

          The Policy change allows us not only to make sure there is no out of
